# Databases

There are four databases workshops that cover parts of the material in this repo.

The workshops use PostgreSQL.  Much of the material applies generically to SQL and other relational database systems, but some of it is specific to PostgreSQL.

Some of the workshops use the database discussed in, and follow much of the content of, the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/), which makes use of the [Saklia database](https://www.jooq.org/sakila).


## Selecting and Joining Data

[Intro presentation](https://gitpitch.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop/)

The workshop follows the files below, which have links to the exercises.

[Part 1](sql/part1.md)

[Part 2](sql/part2.md)



## Exploring Data

See [Exploring Data](sql/explore.md) for materials and exercises.

This workshop uses data files from the [nycflights13 R package](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) and open data from the city of Evanston.

## Updating and Changing Data

[Part 3](sql/part3.md)

[Part 4](sql/part4.md)

## Creating and Designing Databases

[Creating and Designing Materials](sql/createdesign.md)

## R and Python

The [R](/r) and [Python](/python) materials may also be of interest to those taking any of the above workshops.


## Note

These materials are created for an in-person workshop.  Participants will be connecting to a database server that will only be active for the duration of the workshop.  In-person workshop participants do not need to install PostgreSQL.

Those wishing to work through the materials on their own will need to [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on their own systems or run a database instance/server via a cloud computing provider.  

See Section 1. Getting started with PostgreSQL, from the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) for details on how to set up your own database server.

## Supplementary Software

While in-person workshop participants do not need to install PostgreSQL, you will need a terminal program capable of creating an SSH connection to a remote server.  On a Mac, the built-in Terminal program will work.  On Windows, we suggest [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) if you don't already have another program installed.

This repository also includes materials for connecting to a database using Python or R.  For Python, you will need to install the `psycopg2` package.  For R, you will need the package `RPostgres`.
